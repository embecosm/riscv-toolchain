#		    SCRIPT TO CLONE THE RISC-V TOOL CHAIN
#		    =====================================

# Invocation Syntax

#     clone-all.sh [-dev]

# Argument meanings:

#     -dev  Clone Embecosm repos as SSH, rather than HTTPS, allowing write
#           access.

# If the BASE_URL environment variable is set, then that is used as the base of
# all repository URLs, to allow cloning from non-github sources (e.g. local
# mirrors).

# Set the top level directory.
topdir=$(cd $(dirname $0)/..;pwd)

# Are we a developer?
if [ \( $# = 1 \) -a \( "x$1" = "x-dev" \) ]
then
    BASE_URL=git@github.com:embecosm
fi

# Set the default base URL, if it is not already provided by the environment.
if [ -z ${BASE_URL+x} ]
then
    BASE_URL=https://github.com/embecosm
fi
